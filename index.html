<h1 class="intro">Just FUCKING use what you want.</h1>
<p class="introsec">Seriously.</p>

<pre class="description"> <!-- yes i know i'm an idiot, i'll update it later at some point tho !! -->
I don't even know why i'm saying this.
You've seen all of those justfuckinguse- this, that..

Well, i'm saying, <span style="color:#00ffff;">justfuckingusewhatyouwant</span>.

This site is <span style="color:#ff0000;">not perfect</span>. Far from it.
In fact, <span style="color:#ffffff;">it might be the ugliest from all the justfuckinguse ones</span>.

<span style="color:#ffff00;">But do i care? Not really, it brings the point across.

As long as it works. As long as it produces the result you want.
Then there's nothing much you should worry about.</span>

I hate some technologies too, i hate some platforms,
i also hate some ways of doing things.
Maybe i love a bit of good design.

But this site, it's poorly coded, it's made in 10 minutes.
You were able to read it, right? You were able to understand the point.
If yes, i think this website did its job.

<span style="color:#00ff00;">Everyone to their own freedom. Use what you want.</span>
